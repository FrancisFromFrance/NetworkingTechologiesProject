Designing and implementing a network-based chat application in Java using the Java Socket API helped me to significantly 
enhance my understanding of networking technologies. The task allowed me to delve deeper into the principles of client-server communication, 
as I implemented the application using sockets and the Java Socket API. I gained hands-on experience in developing and testing network applications,
which improved my knowledge of network protocols and data transmission.The process of designing and implementing a simulated network system allowed me
to learn about various networking concepts such as IP addresses, subnets, and routing, as well as protocols such as TCP/IP and DNS.
